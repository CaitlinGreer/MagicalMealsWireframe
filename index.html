        <h3>Make finding your meals at Disney World easy</h3>
        <p>The last thing anyone wants to spend time doing on their vacation is figuring out where to eat.  Especially when you've got certain dietary restrictions.  Disney World is full of amazing food, but finding the right options for vegan, vegetarian or gluten free diets can often times be difficult.  Magical Meals is here to help simplify that process and make it easy to find the food you love without losing any of the magic.</p>
